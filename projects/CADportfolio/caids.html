                    <p>My work in CAIDS bridges information technology and humanities research to provide site development for non-profits, computing assistance for researchers, and database establishment and maintenance for historical records. Working in a scrum team on projects in digital humanities has been one of the favorite applications of my skills! Our lab has worked on (and continues to work on) many more cool projects, but these are just the ones that I have contributed significantly to:</p>

                        <summary>Feminist Pedagogy for Teaching Online Database</summary>
                        <p>FPTO is an online guide to implementing feminist pedagogy into the in-person, virtual, and hybrid classroom. I set up this resource database on Wordpress using the All Import and Custom Posts plugins.</p>

                        <summary>Mapping Chinese Churches</summary>
                        <p>As part of our work, data research interns each chose a personal project. There is no comprehensive directory or database of the over a thousand Chinese churches and ministries in the US. This project aims to centralize and visualize this data in one searchable and navigable map. Chinese churches’ names, addresses, websites, and phone numbers were gathered into a single Google Sheet. I compiled this data by 1) running a Python and Playwright-based web scraper developed by Amin Boutarfi on Google Maps through Chromium, 2) comparing my database to regional and general directories, 3) cleaning the data and manually adding in missing entries. I integrated the Google Sheet into a Google My Map and opened global sharing.</p>

                        <p>The Maternal and Child Health Coalition works through advocacy to improve outcomes, experiences, and access to quality, respectful care during pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period. To better communicate their data for the upcoming legislative session, we worked on changing the website theme and uploading more content to enhance our capability to host and showcase MCH's data work, such as Legislative Score Cards and the Birth Outcomes Map.</p>
